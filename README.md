# Medication Inventory Tracker

## Project Overview
The **Medication Inventory Tracker** is a digital system designed to help residential care homes accurately monitor, record, and manage daily medication counts for each resident. The goal is to replace manual paper-based count sheets with a reliable, easy-to-use platform that improves safety, accountability, and transparency in medication management.

This system provides real-time visibility of medication stock levels, tracks daily usage, logs administration events, and alerts staff when medication levels are running low or nearing expiry. It ensures compliance with care home medication standards while reducing administrative workload.
